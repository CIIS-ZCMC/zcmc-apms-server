## üîÑ Annual Operation Plan (AOP) Workflow
The AOP system follows a structured approval process with clearly defined roles and review stages:

### Workflow Columns/Responsibilities:
- **Department/Section/Unit Head or OIC**: Initiates and manages AOP creation
- **Planning Division**: Reviews submitted AOPs for initial approval
- **Division Chief**: Secondary review and approval stage
- **Medical Center Chief**: Final review and approval authority

### Workflow Process:
1. **Initial Planning Stage** (Department/Section/Unit Head):
   - Start with mission input
   - Select Type of Function
   - Select Objective from predefined list
   - If objective is not on the list, input new Objective
   - Input Success Indicator when selecting from list or adding new objective

2. **Activity Definition Stage**:
   - Input Activity details
   - Select person in-charge of the activity
   - Select start month and end month of activity
   - Select Yes/No if GAD-related activity
   - Input target by Quarter
   - Input unit of target (training, item and quantity)
   - Select type of resource (procurement, non-procurement)
   - Input cost for activity
   - Select Expense Class of Unit
   - Submit AOP

3. **Review and Approval Process**:
   - **Planning Division Review**:
     - Reviews AOP of Unit
     - Decision point: "passed review?"
     - If No: AOP returned to department for updates
     - If Yes: Forwards to Division Chief

   - **Division Chief Review**:
     - Reviews AOP of Unit
     - Decision point: "passed review?"
     - If No: AOP returned to department for updates
     - If Yes: Forwards to Medical Center Chief

   - **Medical Center Chief Review**:
     - Views AOP of Unit
     - Approves AOP of Unit
     - Process completes with "End"

4. **Update Process**:
   - If AOP is not approved at any stage, it returns to department
   - Department must update AOP based on feedback
   - Updated AOP re-enters the approval workflow
   - All approvals must be sequential (Planning ‚Üí Division Chief ‚Üí Medical Center Chief)

Each step in this workflow includes validation points to ensure quality and compliance before the AOP can proceed to the next approval level.
